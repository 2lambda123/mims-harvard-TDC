# HLM_RLM
Dataset description: 
- The HLM_RLM datasets predict the metabolic stability of compounds in Rat and Human Liver Microsomes, which is crucial for early-stage drug development. The datasets include 5,590 compounds for rat liver microsomes and 6,013 for human liver microsomes. Compounds are classified as stable or unstable based on their half-life. We have sanitized and organized the datasets, derived from a published paper(DOI: 10.1021/acs.chemrestox.2c00207), into a format with three columns: ID, X, and Y.

Task description: 
- The primary task for these datasets is binary classfication. The compounds with a half-time greater than 30 mins were considered stable(labeled as 0), those with a half-time equal to or less than 30 mins were considered unstable(labeled as 1).

Dataset statistics: 
- HLM dataset: 4771 training compounds, 1131 test compounds, and 111 external compounds (Total 6013)
- RLM dataset: 2512 training compounds, 596 test compounds, and 2482 external compounds (Total 5590)

Data split methods: 
- The processed data were randomly split into the training and test sets with the proportions of 8:2. Hyperparameter settings for the top five models and the D-MPNN of RLM and HLM stability in 10-fold cross-validation are given below.
