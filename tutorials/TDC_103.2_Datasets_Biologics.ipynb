    "For target discovery, gene disease associtation prediction that we discussed in the last tutotorial also applies here. In addition to that, we include miRNA-Target Interaction (MTI) prediction dataset. miRNAs (microRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that control expression of target genes at the post-transcriptional level. It was shown by recent research that they play important roles in disease pathology and celluar processes. miRNA therapeutics refer to insert miRNA into cells whereas sometimes miRNA is also regarded as biomarker for other drug products to target upon. miRNA-target interaction is thus very important because it can identify which miRNA can regulate the target of interest. In TDC, we include the miRTarBase database, which was collected by manually surveying literature and are later validated experimentally. TDC also provides miRNA mature sequence and target amino acid sequence as the features for miRNA and target gene. You can obtain it via:\n"
