Welcome to TDC's documentation!
===============================


**Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC)** is the first unifying framework to systematically access and evaluate machine learning across the entire range of therapeutics.

The collection of curated datasets, learning tasks, and benchmarks in TDC serves as a meeting point for domain and machine learning scientists. We envision that TDC can considerably accelerate machine-learning model development, validation and transition into biomedical and clinical implementation.
